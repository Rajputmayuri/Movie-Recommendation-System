# Movie-Recommendation-System
A machine-learning based recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on similarity, user ratings, and content features. This project uses the MovieLens dataset and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and recommendation algorithms to generate personalized movie suggestions.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an efficient movie recommendation system using Python.

1.Loading and preprocessing MovieLens datasets (movies + ratings)

2.Exploratory data analysis and cleaning

3.Feature extraction using TF-IDF on movie genres/titles

4.Similarity computation (Cosine Similarity / KNN)

5.A function-based recommendation system

6.Interactive search using Jupyter Widgets

7.Evaluation metrics for recommendation quality
